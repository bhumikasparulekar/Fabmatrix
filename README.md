# Fabmatrix
Real-time, edge-ready semiconductor defect classification with CNNs, transfer learning, explainability, and unknown defect detection.
FabMatrix is an Edge-AI system designed to classify eighteen different semiconductor wafer defect sub-types using a fully fine-tuned MobileNetV2 deep learning model. The system processes grayscale microscope images, performs high-accuracy defect prediction, and generates a confidence score for each classification. It also includes a centroid-based unknown defect detection module that identifies out-of-distribution patterns and flags them as “UNKNOWN.”
The project follows a complete training pipeline that converts images to grayscale, resizes them to 224×224, normalizes them, and applies augmentation during training. A MobileNetV2 model pretrained on ImageNet is fully unfrozen and fine-tuned for 100 epochs, with the best model automatically saved based on validation loss. The dataset is structured into train, validation, and test folders containing the 18 defect sub-type classes such as Bridge, Cracks, CMP defects, VIAS defects, and LER defects.


During inference, the system extracts deep features and compares them with pre-computed class centroids. If the distance exceeds the threshold calculated from the validation distribution, the system identifies the sample as an unknown defect and recommends manual inspection. For known defects, the system provides not only the predicted sub-type but also the probable manufacturing root cause and the corrective action engineers should take.
FabMatrix is optimized for real-time industrial deployment. The model is exported to ONNX format and can run on low-latency edge devices using ONNX Runtime, making it suitable for fabs that require secure, offline processing. By reducing manual inspection effort, providing rapid defect identification, improving root-cause understanding, and enabling faster process corrections, this solution supports yield improvement and enhances manufacturing reliability.
The project is built using Python, PyTorch, TorchVision, NumPy, PIL, ONNX Runtime, and supporting utilities. It is fully operational, scalable for additional defect categories, and ready for integration into industrial semiconductor inspection pipelines.
